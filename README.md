# Game Description
### Story
Once upon a time, there were twin brothers named Alex and Riley. They were well-behaved and responsible children; they did their homework and asked their mother for permission to play video games. Their favorite game was "Gizemli İkizler: Zindanın Yankıları". This game, a classic dungeon exploration game, had become their favorite.

But our story doesn't start here. No, the real story starts right here! Come, come a little closer. But not too much... Because the twin brothers fell into this trap.

One day, while playing "Gizemli İkizler: Zindanın Yankıları" again, a fight broke out between the brothers. The brothers, as the name suggests, were constantly bickering. This time the fight was quite intense and Alex, angry, threw the gamepad at Riley's head. Riley was about to go to his mother to complain when unexpected letters and symbols appeared on the TV.

The twin brothers curiously entered the bottom of the television and tried to decipher the meanings of these letters and symbols. However, they got too close. SUDDENLY, TWO SATANIC ARMS PULLED THEM INTO THEIR FAVORITE GAME.

The twin brothers, trapped inside Dungeon, will try to complete the dungeon by supporting each other and using their intelligence. They will encounter new challenges at every step, but by working together and using their mirrors skillfully, they will be able to escape from this magical world. Good luck, twin brothers!

# Sprints
Sprints will be 2 weeks long. At the end of each sprint, a sprint review will be held to evaluate the work done during the sprint and a refirement meeting will be held for the next sprint. Task scoring in sprints will be done with Fibonacci numbers (from 1 to 8).

Story Points:
- 1 - Very Easy
- 2 - Easy
- 3 - Medium
- 5 - Hard
- 8 - Very Hard

When estimating the time for each task, care should be taken to make these times realistic. Tasks are determined before the sprint starts and worked on these tasks during the sprint. New tasks created while the sprint is in progress should be opened in the backlog. If the developers finish their tasks, new task assignments are made from the backlog.

## Sprint 1
- **Start Date:** 24.06.2024
- **End Date:** 07.07.2024
- **Expected Story Points:** 73
- **Completed Story Points:** 68

### Sprint Goal
- Theme and story of the game will be determined.
- The software and hardware tools to be used in the development of the  game will be determined.
- User Stories will be determined and a backlog will be created.
- Generic classes and functions that the developer will use while developing the game will be created. (EventManager, UIManager, ExtensionMethods, etc.)
- Basic character movements will be implemented.

- Cinemachine and Cinemachine Zones will be implemented.

### Daily Scrum Meetings
  <p>We were not doing daily scrum at the beginning of the sprint and everyone was doing their own work. Therefore, our communication with each other decreased and it became difficult to follow who was doing what. Since some of our teammates had different tasks to focus on, we could not determine the voice meeting time and decided to do the daily scrum in writing via discord from June 27, 2024.</p>
