# Game Description
### Story
Once upon a time, there were twin brothers named Alex and Riley. They were well-behaved and responsible children; they did their homework and asked their mother for permission to play video games. Their favorite game was Smash Dungeon. This game, a classic dungeon exploration game, had become their favorite.

But our story doesn't start here. No, the real story starts right here! Come, come a little closer. But not too much... Because the twin brothers fell into this trap.

One day, while playing Smash Dungeon again, a fight broke out between the brothers. The brothers, as the name suggests, were constantly bickering. This time the fight was quite intense and Alex, angry, threw the gamepad at Riley's head. Riley was about to go to his mother to complain when unexpected letters and symbols appeared on the TV.

The twin brothers curiously entered the bottom of the television and tried to decipher the meanings of these letters and symbols. However, they got too close. SUDDENLY, TWO SATANIC ARMS PULLED THEM INTO THEIR FAVORITE GAME.

The twin brothers, trapped inside Dungeon, will try to complete the dungeon by supporting each other and using their intelligence. They will encounter new challenges at every step, but by working together and using their mirrors skillfully, they will be able to escape from this magical world. Good luck, twin brothers!

# Sprints
Sprints will be 2 weeks long. At the end of each sprint, a sprint review will be held to evaluate the work done during the sprint and a refirement meeting will be held for the next sprint. Task scoring in sprints will be done with Fibonacci numbers (from 1 to 8).

Story Points:
- 1 - Very Easy
- 2 - Easy
- 3 - Medium
- 5 - Hard
- 8 - Very Hard

When estimating the time for each task, care should be taken to make these times realistic. Tasks are determined before the sprint starts and worked on these tasks during the sprint. New tasks created while the sprint is in progress should be opened in the backlog. If the developers finish their tasks, new task assignments are made from the backlog.

### Daily Scrum Meetings
  <p>We were not doing daily scrum at the beginning of the sprint and everyone was doing their own work. Therefore, our communication with each other decreased and it became difficult to follow who was doing what. Since some of our teammates had different tasks to focus on, we could not determine the voice meeting time and decided to do the daily scrum in writing via discord from June 27, 2024.</p>

### Sprint Backlog Creation Process and Writing Tasks

<details>
    <summary><h4 style="display: inline; margin: 0; padding: 0;">Trello Board</h4></summary>
    <p>Tasks were created on the Trello board and assigned to the team members. The tasks were created by the Product Owner and the Scrum Master. The categories of the tasks created with the created tags (User Story, Feature, Bug) and the tracking of the story points were provided. </p>
    <p>The board consists of 4 main sections:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Backlog: Lists the tasks to be done in the sprints.</li>
        <li>Sprint: Lists the tasks to be done in the sprint.</li>
        <li>Feature Review / QA: The tasks done in the sprint are tested and reviewed.</li>

### Sprint Backlog

<details>
    <summary><h4 style="display: inline; margin: 0; padding: 0;">Burndown Chart</h4></summary>
    <p>Burndown chart is a graphical representation of work left to do versus time. The outstanding work (or backlog) is often on the vertical axis, with time along the horizontal. That is, it is a run chart of outstanding work. It is useful for predicting when all of the work will be completed.</p>
    <p>This burndown chart consists of 2 lines:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Baseline, shows the planned amount of work at the beginning of the sprint. This line assumes that the work will be completed at an ideal speed (usually at a constant speed) and shows the completion of the planned work over time.</li>
        <li>Remaining Effort, shows the amount of work done. This line is updated by the team every day and tracks the remaining amount of work over time. This way, it can be understood whether the project will be completed on time.</li>

In addition, Sprint-1, Sprint-2, Sprint-3 tags were added to track which sprint the tasks were done in. In the first sprint, while determining the story points, everyone's points were written in the task detail. However, with the decision we took as a team, we removed this and added it as a tag.</p>
